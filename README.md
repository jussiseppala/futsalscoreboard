# futsalscoreboard
This is a very simple Java client application which can be used for example with OBS (https://obsproject.com) to show score board for futsal matches.

So start the application and add a "Window capture" as a new source in OBS. Then finetune what part of the window is shown: Transform / Edit transform / Crop Botton = 266

Using the application is dead simple. See the following screenshot.
